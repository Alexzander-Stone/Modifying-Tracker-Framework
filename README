Project description:
We were given a framework created by Dr. Malloy to create a scene of moving
sprites and animations. Before changing any of the images, we had to go 
through the framework and make changes to the code to improve efficiency andto
teach various programming concepts (Singleton patterns, Data-Driven
programming, Factories, etc). By the end, we created a full scene with
different images and received a framework that we can reuse as our own.

The easiest part of this project: was understanding the game design and programming
related concepts. I've used game engines in the past (Unity, Gamemaker) and
frameworks (LibGDX), so many of the concepts discussed in class related to my
past work. This helped to illustrate a visual element of how each concept could
be implemented (like singletons).

The problems I had during this project were: mainly due to my poor drawing
skills. I was lucky to have a great piece of art found from online 
(referenced below) for the background from past game design work in Unity. For
the sprites that were floating around the screen, I decided to create them
myself. Although they werent very extravagant, it was still time consuming yet
worth it in the end.
